# go-sso

> **Status: planned.** This repository does not currently provide an
> installable package, a released version, or a runtime API.

`go-sso` reserves the planned Golib boundary for enterprise SSO provider
lifecycle, verified-domain routing, discovery policy, attribute mapping, JIT
provisioning, organization membership, enforcement, break-glass recovery,
enterprise token custody, and directory synchronization. The plan keeps those
concepts separate from protocol wire handling, persistence, SCIM, and
application concerns.

## Planned responsibility

The future root package is intended to own storage-neutral enterprise SSO
policy, provider and login lifecycle, protocol-neutral transactions and
assertions, provisioning coordination, enforcement, and directory-sync state.
Its contracts remain proposals until they are implemented, reviewed, verified,
and released.

## Non-goals

The planned root boundary does not own:

- OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or SAML wire handling;
- SCIM protocol behavior or generic identity user interfaces;
- consumer social-login provider catalogs; or
- database clients, migrations, transactions, caches, or persistence adapters.

Those concerns may become separate modules or compose existing Golib packages.
Their presence in planning material does not make them available here.

## Lifecycle and ownership

Implementation, hardening, and release have not started. The current module
declaration exists only so repository tooling can validate the planned module
identity, family, ownership, and lifecycle metadata.

The plan requires caller-owned configuration and runtime resources, copied
mutable inputs, context-bounded external operations, and no package-owned
background work. These are design constraints, not claims about released
behavior.

## Planning and verification

The [repository goal](docs/goal.md) and `modules.json` record the planning scope
and schema-v2 engineering inventory. Planned lifecycle state excludes this
module from installable and released consumer catalogs. The local
`make cohesion` target validates that boundary with the exact checksum-pinned
`go-library-tools` release declared in `.golib.yaml`.

Passing repository checks proves only that the planning scaffold and metadata
are internally consistent. It does not prove SSO behavior, protocol support,
or an API.
